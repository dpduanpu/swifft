GOALS
-----

* Foreatch swifft-{haar|db2|db4}:
	* analyze error wrt number of coeffs dropped
	* try different ``truncation schemes``
	* try to estimate error wrt truncation

* Time and error banchmarking:
	* FFTw
	* swifft-{haar|db2|db4}
	* FFFT
	* undersampled FFTw

* Test these signals, for different sizes (+ noise)
	* pure frequency (sine)
	* constant
	* localized gaussian
	* narrow peak
	* random

WHAT I HAVE FOUND
-----------------

* I can`t really compare truncated FFT with Haar...
* for Haar wavelets, time to do wavelet transform is not so big (ie, flops are cheap)
* prunning H and G is not good (because we can`t truncate the for loop, it acts on large and small elements simultaneously)
* it helps a little big to use non-orthogonal Haar filters
